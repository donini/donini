### Hello üëã

I‚Äôm Donini, just a normal developer who wants to spread your ideas and knowledge about development and the WordPress world.

- Currently working @ [SUPERCHARGED LLC.](https://supercharged.co/) and being SUPERCHARGED everyday ‚ö°Ô∏èüíú
- Currently working @ [Toptal](https://toptal.com/) as WordPress Engineer and CMS Screener

Most of my code is private due to contracts but I've developed some cool public stuff such as [Labrador Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/donini/labrador-jekyll-theme), [DON WP Security Plugin](https://github.com/donini/don-security), integrations from WordPerss and [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/donini/scream-and-post), and Amazon Echo devices.

I also like to speak in some conferences around the world very often, you can check some of my talk decks [here](https://donini.me/category/talks/).

For more, you can check my personal [website](https://donini.me/) or my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/donini).
